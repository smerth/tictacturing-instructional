# Finishing TicTacTuring



This app is currently broken:

- [ ] The game plays but the computer moves are purely random
- [ ] The login doesn't work.  Auth0 support unable to troubleshoot.
- [ ] Cannot test the game results page without the authentication



Possible ways forward:

- [ ] remove tutorial Auth0-lock code and replace with code from official Auth0-lock tutorial
- [ ] remove Relay and replace with Apollo, or, update Relay classic to Relay Modern
